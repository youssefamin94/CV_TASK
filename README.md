Kindly ensure the paths to the data is compatible when you run it in your cloud environment in order of the notebook to run properly (upload the data to drive if working with Colab and adjust the links to data in my code (eg. the path to the main dataset (efg-input.zip) / the path to logos directory / the path to test_set directory)), I uploaded the data that you need to run the notebook :) .
